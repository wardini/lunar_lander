put all of these files in a single folder
have python installed with the following libraries and versions

Python - 3.10.0
Numpy - 1.21.5
Pygame-ce - 2.2.1
Pygbag - 0.6.6    

You can probably use later versions of these libraries but for now, I couldn't get everything running with the new versions and I don't know why.

Anyway, this game can be run three ways.

python main.py

pygbag main.py
Then open a browser with http://localhost:8000/

Zip the contents of build/web and upload them to an itch.io project
Run the game from itch.io

Good Luck.
